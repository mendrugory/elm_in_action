# Elm in Action
## Chapter 3
In this chapter we embed a javascript code generated from Elm code in a html code.
We have worked with the Elm Architecture in order to build a simple Photo Web App.

### Compile
```bash
$ elm-make PhotoGroove.elm --output elm.js
```

### Run
`Open index.html in your favourite browser`
